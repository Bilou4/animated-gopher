# Animated Gopher

Is your life boring? Feel like something is missing?

Animated Gopher is that something.

## Install on your lifeless webpage

First, place the lifeless gopher on your page.
It will be disappointing, just like everything else.

```html
<img data-gopher src="https://bsdavidson.github.io/animated-gopher/src/gopher.svg">
```

Next, add this script to the page to bring it to life.

```html
<script src="https://bsdavidson.github.io/animated-gopher/dist/gopher.min.js"></script>
```
